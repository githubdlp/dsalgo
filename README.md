This is a spring boot project. <br>
Run using maven command : "spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=<SERVER_PORT>" <br>
Set the port before running. If you dont have anything running on 8080 then you can omit server.port flag.

Once the application has come up. Call "<HOST_NAME>:SERVER_PORT" in the browser to see the list of all available programs.<br>
Call specific program endpoint to see all available URIs within that program eg. "<HOST_NAME>:SERVER_PORT/PROGRAM"
