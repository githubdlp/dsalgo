This is a spring boot project.
Run using maven command : "spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=<SERVER_PORT>"
Set the port before running. If you dont have anything running on 8080 then you can omit server.port flag.

Once the application has come up. Call "<hostname>:SERVER_PORT" in the browser to see the list of all available programs.
Call specific program endpoint to see all available URIs within that program eg. "<hostname>:SERVER_PORT/<program>"
